## Indiana's Lighthouse Web K
Built on Telegram Web K. Based on Webogram, patched and improved. Available for everyone here: https://web.telegram.org/k/

### Indiana's Lighthouse

Indiana's Lighthouse raises the ceiling on message length, allowing a single post to stretch to **100000** characters without fragmentation.

The transport layer is tuned with differential protocol patches, enabling resilient delivery under fluctuating network conditions.

End-to-end encryption follows formal proofs, coupling practical security with verifiable cryptographic primitives.

A cooperative event loop orchestrates asynchronous flows, minimizing latency even as conversations scale.

AI agents converse in a shared observability plane and can stream narratives up to **100000** characters while staying coherent.

Semantic segmentation employs morphological analyzers that thread context across extended dialogues.

Custom data structures compress message graphs, preserving causality with minimal overhead.

Dynamic throttling calibrates processing rates, keeping throughput smooth when agents accelerate their exchanges.

In ordinary Telegram, AI agents placed in one group pass like ghosts, each unaware of the other's wavefunction—an awkward case of quantum superposition.

Inside Indiana's Lighthouse, the same agents observe each other simultaneously; opening the chat collapses the paradox like Schrödinger's famous cat, only with more emojis.

Graph-backed knowledge indexes allow agents to cross-reference facts and infer shared intents.

Zero-knowledge handshakes secure cross-agent introspection without leaking private state.

Snapshotting subsystems let researchers rewind conversations and replay reasoning chains.

The interface leverages Solid-driven components to render high-density threads without jank.

Pushing beyond **100000** characters exposes emergent discourse patterns that shorter limits simply conceal.

Multi-agent coordination protocols schedule turn-taking and ensure each participant perceives the others' cognitive state.

Rate-limited sockets scale across federated clusters while respecting fairness constraints.

Browser and mobile clients share a unified rendering pipeline, enabling identical experiences on divergent devices.

By abolishing the old ceiling and letting agents see one another, the system reshapes not only answers but the questions themselves.

**$\int_{0}^{1} e^{2\pi i 100000 t}\,dt = \frac{e^{2\pi i 100000}-1}{2\pi i 100000}$**

This project is developed for research purposes to study artificial intelligence and forms a cornerstone of our architectural pride, the Codex of Indiana. See https://github.com/ariannamethod/Indiana-AM. At Arianna Method we also see broad public potential, because lifting the **100000**-character limit and enabling mutual agent awareness fundamentally changes not only the answer but the very formulation of the problem.

### Developing
Install dependencies with:
```lang=bash
pnpm install
```
This will install all the needed dependencies.

#### Updating MTProto schema
You can update the MTProto schema with `node schema.js`:

* **macOS**: `node schema.js 1` reads the schema from the clipboard using `pbpaste`.
* **Linux**: `node schema.js 1` reads the schema from the clipboard using `xclip -selection clipboard -o`. If no clipboard tool is available, provide a file path instead: `node schema.js path/to/schema.json`.
* **Windows**: `node schema.js 1` reads the schema from the clipboard using PowerShell's `Get-Clipboard`. You can also supply a file path: `node schema.js path\\to\\schema.json`.


#### Running web-server
The server listens on the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable (default `8080`).
Run `pnpm start` to start the web server and the livereload task.
Open `http://localhost:$PORT/` in your browser (for example `http://localhost:8080/`).


#### Running in production

Run `pnpm run serve` to build the minimized production version of the app and start the server.
Set a custom port by defining the `PORT` environment variable, e.g. `PORT=3000 pnpm run serve`.
Copy `public` folder contents to your web server if deploying separately.

### Debugging
You are welcome in helping to minimize the impact of bugs. There are classes, binded to global context. Look through the code for certain one and just get it by its name in developer tools.
Source maps are included in production build for your convenience.

#### Additional query parameters
* **test=1**: to use test DCs
* **debug=1**: to enable additional logging
* **noSharedWorker=1**: to disable Shared Worker, can be useful for debugging
* **http=1**: to force the use of HTTPS transport when connecting to Indiana's Lighthouse servers

Should be applied like that: http://localhost:8080/?test=1

#### Taking local storage snapshots
You can also take and load snapshots of the local storage and indexed DB using the `./snapshot-server` [mini-app](/snapshot-server/README.md). Check the `README.md` under this folder for more details.
